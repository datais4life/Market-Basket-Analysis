# Market-Basket-Analysis
<p> A telecommunications company is attempting to understand their customer base in a more detailed manner. The company has a data set containing customer transactions for products that they offer to customers and would like to figure out which products the customersâ€™ favor. A market basket analysis on the data set will be conducted to produce this information. The analysis will answer the question of: What group of products are the customers most likely to purchase? The goal of this analysis is to find a group of products that the customers want to buy. This is a great way to evaluate the products the company offers and determine their value for the business. </p>
